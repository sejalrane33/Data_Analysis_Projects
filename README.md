# E-Commerce-Olist-Project
E-commerce (electronic commerce) is the activity of electronically buying or selling products on online services or over the Internet.
In this project first of all studied the datasets and started cleaning the data.
Then merged all the Olist datasets and established relationship between them based on the common columns.
After that, tried to understand the given KPI’s and calculated the key information in the Master Table (merged Olist datasets) which helps to create the dashboard based on KPI’s.
Then implemented the KPI’s
Finally, based on the implemented KPI’s, created some Dashboards in MS Excel, PowerBI and Tableau. Also created queries in MySQL.
